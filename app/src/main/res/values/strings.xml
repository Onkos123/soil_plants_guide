    <string name="loren_ipson">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using \'Content here, content here\', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for \'lorem ipsum\' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

    <string name="cambissolo">Cambissolos são solos constituídos por material mineral com horizonte B incipiente subjacente a qualquer tipo de horizonte superficial (exceto hístico com 40 cm ou mais de espessura) ou horizonte A chernozêmico quando o B incipiente apresentar argila de atividade alta e saturação por bases alta. identificados normalmente em relevos forte ondulados ou montanhosos, que não apresentam horizonte supefcial A Húmico. São solos de fertilidade natural variável. Apresentam como principais limitações para uso, o relevo com declives acentuados, a pequena profundidade e a ocorrência de pedras na massa do solo.</string>
    <string name="chernossolo">Chernossolo é uma ordem cujos solos são caracterizados por conterem um horizonte escuro, rico em matéria orgânica, bem espesso e com alto teor de cálcio. São ocorrentes tipicamente em áreas de pradarias, sob vegetação gramínea, e de clima frio e semiárido. Os chernossolos caracterizam-se por seus horizontes relativamente espessos, duros e nas camadas mais superficiais apresentam uma coloração escura que se dilui conforme avançam nas camadas. Os chernossolos têm seu material de origem rico em cálcio e magnésio, formando um solo com altos teores de argila, cálcio, magnésio e carbonato de cálcio em sua composição. Os chernossolos são solos muito férteis e recomendados para o cultivo.</string>
    <string name="espodossolo">Espodossolo é uma ordem caracterizada por solos distróficos com um horizonte claro com altíssima porcentagem de areia na textura sobre outro horizonte escuro extremamente endurecido. No campo, pode ser identificada pela cor do horizonte espódico, que varia desde cinzenta, de tonalidade escura ou preta, até avermelhada ou amarelada, e pela nítida diferenciação de horizontes. Podem apresentar um horizonte cimentado como fragipã, duripã ou “ortstein” subjacente ao horizonte espódico. São solos, em geral, moderada a fortemente ácidos, normalmente com saturação por bases baixa (distróficos), podendo ocorrer altos teores de alumínio extraível. A textura é predominantemente arenosa, sendo menos comumente textura média e raramente argilosa (tendente para média ou siltosa) no horizonte B espódico.</string>
    <string name="luvissolo">Luvissolo é um ordem de solo caracterizada por horizonte subsuperficial B textural constituído por argilas de atividade alta e eutrófico, abaixo de um horizonte A (exceto A chernozêmico) ou abaixo de horizonte E. São solos rasos, ou seja, raramente ultrapassam 1 m de profundidade e apresentam usualmente mudança textural abrupta. As limitações de uso relacionam-se à quantidade de pedras no horizonte superficial que pode dificultar o uso de mecanização agrícola e a suscetibilidade à compactação.</string>
